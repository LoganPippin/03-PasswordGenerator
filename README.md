# 03-PasswordGenerator

## Project Description
I made this webpage to help people create randomly generated passwords based on a field of inputs that the user would choose based on their password needs. This page asks the user to input the length of the password and the things they want it to include like upper case letters, lower case letter, numbers, and special characters. It then generates a password based on the criteria entered and displays the password on the page in the password text field. I learned how to use prompts and functions to create strings of things and how to include or exclude certain inputed factors into the string.
